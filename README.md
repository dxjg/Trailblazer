# Trailblazer

Be a trailblazer! Whether you're a walker, runner, hiker, wanderer, this
application can be the diary for the trails that you've trekked. For each trail
you set a:

* Name
* Photo
* Date
* Distance
* Description

This way you can save all of your best outdoor memories in one place.

Every trail must have a name and a date in order to be saved. HealthKit data is
added, edited, and deleted as expected for your trails, as long as those trails
have distances recorded. But distances are not required. The data can be seen in
the Health application under the Activity section.

This application is currently optimized for the iPhone 7 simulator.
